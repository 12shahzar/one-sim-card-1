In Canada, we offer roaming on Rogers, Bell Canada, and Telus. Some other roaming SIM providers do this too. What makes OneSimCard different though is the “No Network Steering” service."

We offer no steering, which mean instructing the device to register on the network with the best signal.",

It is not that OneSimCard does not care about margins. We do. However, offering quality and reliable service with the best possible coverage is more important."

As eSIMs require up to 92% less space within the device when compared to regular SIMs, there is more available space for other components or to further decrease the size of the device itself.   In addition, as e SIMs are soldered within the device, they can withstand high temperatures and vibrations much better than regular SIM cards. This feature make eSIMs or eUICC SIMs  especially useful in devices serving mobile IoT applications such a connected vehicles or in any device installed close to engines or any other heat emitting machinery.   But, the most important advantage of eSIMs is the way in which they are programmed."

This cost and effort is entirely eliminated by the use of e SIM cards.",

The IMSI number is compose of 2 parts which indentify both the GSM network where the subscriber holds their account and the subscriber’s unique identification number. Usage of multiple IMSI numbers are especially interesting for mobile devices which cross borders. The device user is able to utilize 2 or more different operational profiles for their devices.  Those operational profiles could be with a domestic Service Provider and additional international roaming Service Providers thereby creating both cost savings and better coverage.  As embedded SIM cards are able to switch seamlessly between IMSIs, a device crossing borders could be automatically switched from the regular domestic carrier to an international roaming carrier (such as OneSimCard)  as soon as the  device is registered abroad.  All  IMSI profiles are  housed on the embedded SIM and the customer would seamlessly enjoy outstanding rates and service both domestically and internationally."
